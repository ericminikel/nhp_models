### NHP models

This repository holds the data and source code for the following manuscript in preparation:

[Mortberg MA, Minikel EV. Vallabh SM, **Analysis of non-human primate models for
evaluating prion disease therapeutic efficacy.** _To be posted to bioRxiv_]().

This manuscript describes the aggregation of a dataset of reported prion infection studies in non-human primates based on a systematic literature review, followed by the analysis of that dataset to determine the potential parameters, statistical power, and challenges and limitations for prion therapeutic efficacy studies in such models.
